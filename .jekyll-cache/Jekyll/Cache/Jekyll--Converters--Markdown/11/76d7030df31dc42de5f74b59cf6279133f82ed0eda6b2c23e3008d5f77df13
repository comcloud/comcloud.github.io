I"¸<p>A work at home parent is an entrepreneur who works from home and integrates parenting into his or her business activities. They are sometimes referred to as a WAHM <em>(work at home mom)</em> or a WAHD <em>(work at home dad)</em>.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating commuting, or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for childcare outside the home,[1] others integrate child rearing into their work day and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.</p>

<p>Many WAHPs start home-based businesses in order to care for their children while still creating income. The desire to care for one‚Äôs own children, the incompatibility of a 9-to-5 work day with school hours or sick days, and the expense of childcare prompt many parents to change or leave their jobs in the workforce to be available to their children. Many WAHPs build a business schedule that can be integrated with their parenting duties.</p>

<p>The Fusion Festival combines all styles of the underground electronic music scene and various other styles, sometimes depending on the attendees who choose to play their own music. It is described as a space people go to free their minds from their everyday lives, jobs, studies and other responsibilities. It is the result of the search for an alternative through music, to the system ‚Äúpeople are forced to live in‚Äù. People go to the Fusion to experience a different way of socializing and living, where experiencing one another freely, sharing love for music and art connects different scenes and minds. It is a clothing-optional event. Art installations include performance arts, static artworks, sculptures, art cars and various other forms.</p>

<p>Fusion Festival began in 1997 near the city of L√§rz in north-eastern Germany, about 160 km from Berlin and 230 km from Hamburg.</p>

<h2 id="festival-site">Festival Site</h2>

<p>The location is on the original grass-covered grounds of a disused military airfield (at 53¬∞20‚Ä≤48.11‚Ä≥N 12¬∞44‚Ä≤23.25‚Ä≥E for the 234-hectare area central field) about 4.5 km (2.25 miles) due north of the modern Rechlin-L√§rz Airfield facility. The site was first acquired by the German Empire in 1916 as an aviation research and training ground, opening the facility for use by the Luftstreitkr√§fte in August 1918. After the establishment of the Luftwaffe in 1935, the field served as the Erprobungsstelle Rechlin central military aircraft test facility of the Third Reich through early 1945, and it was captured by the Soviet Red Army on May 2, 1945, for use by the VVS.</p>

<p>There are grass-covered concrete hangars (actual bunkers) from that time that were used for Soviet fighter aircraft (hence the Cyrillic transliteration of the festival name and various stages, as many Cyrillic inscriptions were still present on the site). The airfield was reopened for civilian use in 1994 and sold to the M√ºritz Airpark Group in 2010. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Festival">Source</a>]</p>
